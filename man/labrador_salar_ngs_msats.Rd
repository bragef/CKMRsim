\title{Next-generation-sequencing-genotyped microsatellites from Labrador Atlantic salmon}
\format{An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 1478 rows and 204 columns.}

\description{
A data frame of genotypes from multiple collections of Atlantic salmon
\emph{Salmo salar}.  From Ian Bradbury and colleagues.  See citation XXXX.
}
\details{
Each row is a single fish.  Column \code{collection} tells which collection the
fish is from.  A collection is a group of fish that have similar allele frequencies
(as if they are from a single population, or from multiple populations that are not much
differentiated, genetically).  Column \code{indiv} gives the unique individual
identifier for the individual. The remaining columns come in pairs, each giving one of
the two gene copies in a diploid locus.  The second column of each locus has the same
name as the first, with a "_1" appended to it.

There are 1,468 fish from 26 different collections, genotyped at 101
microsatellite loci.  Missing data are denoted with NA.  Alleles are coded
by integers that give the length of the allele, as inferred from NGS read data
using the program MEGASAT (CITATION XXXX).
